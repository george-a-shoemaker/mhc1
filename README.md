# Exported Obsidian

This is a published [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) "vault" which is a collection of notes written in MarkDown.

To export my notes as html, I'm using the Obsidian plug in [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export)

I'm using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish the html from this repo.
